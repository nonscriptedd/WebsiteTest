This is only a test website, do not expect this to be a good project.

I am thinking to install arch but when i did, it was disasterous. Not only Arch Linux failed, but so did Windows 11. I was just thinking i should give a config file for hyprland for those who even use hyprland. This website, however, was made because i wanted an easy way to look a tutorial or a video much more socialistic with friends.

While this might seem like a lie, it is not.
